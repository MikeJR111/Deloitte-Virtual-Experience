### Task2 Data Analysis: 

Build a dashboard to explore the client's telemetry data.:

Steps: 
1. Create a calculated measure field "Unhealthy" with the value of 10 for every unhealthy status (representing 10min of potential down time since the previous message).
2. Create a bar-chart: Down Time per Factory.
3. Create new sheet with a new bar-chart: Down Time per Device Type.
4. Create a Dashboard with the 2 previous sheets and set the first chart to be used as a filter (selecting factory in the first chart, shows only the down time of the machines in this factory there in the second chart).
